# 4coder Customization
My 4coder customization layer for 4coder 4.1.4+ (Beta)

* 4coder_ryanb.cpp, 4coder_draw.cpp and 4coder_ryanb_build.bat go in: 4coder\custom
* theme-ryanb.4coder (optional) goes in: 4coder\themes
* config.4coder (optional) goes in: 4coder\

Many settings can be adjusted under the CONSTANTS section near the top of 4coder_ryanb.cpp

Features:
* Open a function-helper tool-tip with F1 while the cursor is near a function name
* Jump to function/struct definition with ctrl+enter or ctrl+click when cursor is on token
* Double-click to select token (double-click slowly, or triple-click normally)
* Bookmark cursor position when idle every 3 seconds, or manually with ctrl+shift+alt+b
* Advance through bookmarks with ctrl++ or ctrl+-
